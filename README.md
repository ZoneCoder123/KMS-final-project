# KMS-final-project

The time has come! Show us what you can do with the skills you have accumulated this year.  

A Giant Fortune 500 Company is looking for young and upcoming programmers yo join their ranks! They have begun a contest to see what YOU the student are passionate about and capable of.  They've given you a list of requirements (given at the bottom) that will need to be fulfilled in order to participate in the contest.  

Remember everything that you've accomplished and what you have achieved on your beginning journey to programming.  Take your skills and design a website on any subject that you are passionate about.  Be sure that it is a topic that has lots of information.  

Your project will begin with a wireframe.  Once the wireframe is completed, you can begin working on your website.

## The Steps

### Fork and Clone

- Fork and clone this repo to your local computer.  
- Remember to have it saved in your webdev folder!

### Wireframe/Concept Planning

- Just like in class, on a piece of paper give the teachers a theme for your website and a design layout that you have come up with.
  - Be sure it's a theme that has plenty of information - you don't want to run out of information and can't find anything on it.
  - Keep it PG - anything too mature will be denied
- This *must* be completed and shown to a teacher before you can begin working on your project!

### Create your files and link them together!

- An HTML, CSS, and Javascript file are all required on this final project.
- Remember to link all of your files together using a <link> tag and a <script> tag
- Be sure to console.log a sanity check, this will be important, don't delete it! Comment out the console.log when you have confirmed it's connected.
