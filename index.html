	<h1>A Collection of Various Images of Cute Sea Animal Life</h1>
	<h2>Biography:</h2>
	<h3>Hi! I am Bergson Isaac Georgie Apostle Nicholias Ramsey! (My full name is longer, but I have shortened it for convenience.) For years, the common people have thought that space was the greatest mystery. But fret not! I have discovered a more intriguing alternative. The mysterious world, of the sea! I have disclosed a photo of myself below, so take a good look!</h3>

	<h1>Part One: "Seals"</h1>
	<h2>These little bundles of joy make your heart just melt, don't they? What fascinating creatures. We here at Berg Inc. take these care packages very seriously, and have drone footage of every seal on planet Earth. (And some footage for seals that live on Proximus Blubberius, but let's not talk about those.) Look, here's one now!</h2>

	<h1>Part Two: "Dolphins</h1>
	<h2>The most memorable of sea life, the dolphin. We all know the dolphin at this point, so allow me to put some knowledge on your heads. The sonar, may have been inspired by dolphins. We have also come to the conclusion dolphins are actually highly intelligent ball balancing devices. The dolphin uses its highly adapted sonar to scout surroundings, but most importantly, calculate the exact trajectory of balls. Here we see some dolphins applauding with the audience.</h2>

	<h1>Part Three: "Narwhals"</h1>
	<h2>These amazing specimens are actually descendants of the Jedi, now honing in their lightsaber skills on a horn they have attached to their head. Some say when an enemy narwhal invades territory, both the narwhal's horns light up in red and blue with a sharp laser noise before the duel begins. But since we have no drone footage of that, here's a specimen of fine intelligence, performing and entertaining our workers.</h2>

	<h1>Part Four: "Their Electrical Capabilities"</h1>
	<h2>Yes, you heard me right. These animals have hidden potential. Their ability to be used as a Wifi Hotspot. Yes, if you put an ordinary laptop on top of an ordinary seal, and proceed to play an ordinary game of Fortnite, you will have Extraordinary Wifi. You just need to input the password, which according to the knowledge of scientists, is "**************", or "SeaLifeWifi999". This is actually how many sea animals bond with their siblings, getting together and playing games, filling up hundreds of servers in hundreds of games, including Fortnite, TF2, Overwatch, PubG, and Many others. Just remember that when you get a kill, you may or may not have killed a seal, dolphin, or narwhal.</h2>
